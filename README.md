Mlerm code
There has been a battle between mlem and blep for a while now. After some thorough research it would appear that ‘mlem’ is an action, shown best by the cat mleming some water.

Bleps, however, almost seem accidental. The tongue is left protruding from the mouth in a care-free fashion leaving the blep owner to look like they have been suddenly been shocked.


Boops are more clearly identified and are most commonly associated with a light tap on the nose.
